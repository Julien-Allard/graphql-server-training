#GraphQL server training

---

A little back-end project to help me grasp GraphQL with the Apollo library.

The goal here was to create my own GraphQL API to fetch data from the [Rick & Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/).
I tried to manipulate GraphQL/Apollo the best I could to see what it had to offer.
